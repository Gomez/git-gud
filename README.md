## High Level

Step 1. Mindset

Think like a mad hacker scientist. Psyops your own brain through fashion if you struggle with this, get a dress shirt and tie and nice jacket from a store or for your vtuber avatar (search booth.pm).

Step 2: Start a journal

Get into the habit of making documentation along the way, it is the best way to scale one-self. You can use hackmd and track your progress as you learn for easy sharing - notes make it faster to receive help and can become useful community contributions too.
